## Features

### Advisories

Advisories are automatically detected events that the observer might want to switch to.
To make switching to this event easier, the observer slot number is displayed next to an icon noting the type of advisory.
The observer should still make his own judgement of the situation.

All possible advisories are (with increasing priority):

| Advisory                               | Type          | Description                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/xR9eknI.png)   | Default       | This is displayed when no other events are happening.                                                                          |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/FCZ8oB0.png)   | Sole survivor | Only one member of a team is left standing. It's a good idea to observe this player, as all action will involve him.           |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/DD2El5N.png)   | Bomb plant    | A terrorist has the bomb in his hands on a bombsite. Chances are that he'll plant it soon.                                     |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/Xy1oLON.png)   | Defusing      | A CT is defusing the bomb. Because of a CSGO limitation, which CT is defusing is unclear if multiple CTs are on the bomb site. |

### Advanced player dots

Just like in the default CSGO radar, players are represented as dots. Every dot has its observer slot number on top of it.

The type of dots displayed by Boltobserv:

| Dot                                    | Type              | Description                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/TfzvrAS.png)   | Default           | Player dots as seen on the normal CSGO radar, normally with a slot number on them.                                   |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/4uuaPvv.png)   | Grenade equipped  | These players have any kind of grenade in their hands. Very useful for spotting nade setups on the radar.            |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/dEDwuue.png)   | Dead              | Killed players are still faintly visible on the radar as a small cross.                                              |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/AT9Ee6y.png)   | Bomb carrier      | For Ts only. Shows the player that has the C4 with them. Easily spottable on the radar because of the color difference.   |

### Clean radar backgrounds

Using radar backgrounds from [simpleradar.com](http://simpleradar.com/) that are even more accurate and clean than those in-game.
They're also much easier on the eyes.

### Infinitely scalable

Because Boltobserv runs as an external application, it can be resized to be whatever size you want, and be moved to any display you want.
Running without window borders enables it to dedicate as much space as possible to the radar.

## Installation

1. Download the latest .zip form the [releases](https://github.com/boltgolt/boltobserv/releases) page and unzip it.
2. Copy the `gamestate_integration_boltobserv.cfg` file from the .zip to your CSGO config folder (the same folder you'd put an `autoexec.cfg`). For most installations this should be found at `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`.
3. You're done! Start the `Boltobserv.exe` file in the unzipped folder. Boltobserv should now automatically connect to CSGO when it's launched.

Please report any bugs or feature requests here on Github.
